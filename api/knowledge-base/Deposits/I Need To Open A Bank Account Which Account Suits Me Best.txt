Question: I Need To Open A Bank Account. Which Account Suits Me Best ?

Answer: Savings accounts are useful for putting in and withdrawing funds from time to time, and the passbook can be helpful for identification/address proof.However when you need to put funds aside for some time, the Fixed Deposit type will earn better interest. Under this if interest is required each month then choose a Monthly Income Scheme, otherwise choose the DRIC scheme in which you get interest on interest.Recurring deposits are good for saving regularly every month when you have a target date/amount in mind, or as part of a regular savings plan.We also have other schemes including some designed specially for NRI customers.In case certain identification/address documents are not immediately available, a No Frills Savings account can be opened with some restrictions on transactions.
