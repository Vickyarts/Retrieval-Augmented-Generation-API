Question: I Have A Loan Already Running In VIC Bank, Am I Eligible For Other/Personal Loan?

Answer: Yes, subject to the repayment record on the present loan. We will also need to make an assessment of your repayment capacity [considering all loans put together], whether you meet the norms, and whether additional security will be necessary.
