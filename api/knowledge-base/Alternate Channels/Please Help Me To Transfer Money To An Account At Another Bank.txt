Question: Please Help Me To Transfer Money To An Account At Another Bank.

Answer: The money may be transferred within India through Internet Banking using the NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer) system which operates at set times during the day, or the RTGS(Real Time Gross Settlement) system which operates almost immediately but has a minimum amount eligible.You may also give a cheque to your branch with a request to do the transfer. Mobile Banking may also be used with NEFT.The amount can be transferred to any bank branch which is listed in the system and has an IFSC code number. If the beneficiary branch is not listed, then a DD (Demand Draft) on the nearest branch must be purchased and sent.Alternatively you may use the IMPS [Interbank Mobile Payment System] to transfer funds through your mobile using the other person's mobile as the reference.
